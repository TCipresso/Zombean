# Features 
Zombean features 2 maps:

Wheel of Fortune, and City

Wheel of Fortune: Fun map/level idea I had. Map was meant the challenge the player in a more unique way. The level is a literal wheel of fortune. This map reacts to gameplay and elevates gameplay as well. Once the player reaches a certain score the map will spin.
Making it more difficult for the player to move, and create a dynamic challenge. In that wherever the wheel lands after spinning. A certain hazard or good fortune will spawn. This can either reward or harm the player or a bit of both. This allows and interesting element of RNG
to gameplay and provides a unique challenge to the player.

City: Map designed for close quarters and better visuals. Map is has a much higher difficulty than the other due to the close quarters nature of the map. Looks visually like a city going through a zombie apocalypse.

Wheel of fortune sections(6 sections):

Construction: Build a random set of buildings on the map. Purpose: create less space for the player to move around the map.

Money Sign: Spawn a Cash Shower. Purpose, fun to see and who doesn't like money.

Skull: Spawns the ZOMBOSS. Giant purple bean with a massive attack range and health pool. Purpose: Give players a big threat to worry about.

Exclamation Point: Spawn Fire tornado that will randomly move across the map for 30 seconds that can hurt the player AND Zombeans. Purpose: Create a hazard that CAN help the player, but still makes the player be cautious.

Lasers: Spawn laser beams that will shoot at the player. Laser fire after a small delay to let the player dodge. Purpose: creates a solid threat that forces the player to possibly move into less desired positions. Plus gives a good feeling when you dodge all the lasers.

Question marks: Nothing happens Player has been blessed with No change or challenge.
